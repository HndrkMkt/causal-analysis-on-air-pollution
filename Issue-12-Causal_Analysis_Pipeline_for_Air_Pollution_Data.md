## Summary

Learning how to recover causal structures from heterogeneous observational big data is key to enrich the process of understanding causal hypothesis in different challenging problems of human-related activities like climate change, pollution analysis, genetics or computer science. Problems faced in these disciplines have the characteristic of being potentially explained not only by a set of miscellaneous multivariate time series processes but also by static features that not necessarily change with time. Yet another difficulty when trying to recover the underlying causal structure from these problems is the potential exponential increase of the number of hypotheses introduced by nonlinear relations in the data. Here we introduce a pipeline that integrates different big-data heterogeneous sources, supporting the integration through the use of feature tables, generates intermediate data sets based on user-defined aggregations and explores different linear and nonlinear conditional independence tests which finally have to be validated by domain expert knowledge, with the help of visual tools generated by the proposed system with the help of the TIGRAMITE package available in Python. We validate the framework at the example of recovering causal structures from pollution sensor data for the city of Berlin, integrated with different weather station data for the corresponding locations of the sensors. The experiments show how the causal independence test, the hyper-parameters and the domain knowledge play a big role on the recovered causal structure. Our system allows different techniques for causal discovery and has the potential of being set up to recover causal networks in different heterogeneous observational big-data problems.
